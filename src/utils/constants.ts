Behold, the Ten Commandments:

I. Thou shalt respect all members at all times — harassment, discrimination, racism, sexism, and hate speech will not be tolerated.

II. Thou shalt not spam nor promote thyself without permission — seek admin approval before sharing your business, projects, or promotions.

III. Thou shalt not share unsafe or harmful content — malicious websites, pirated materials, and dangerous links are forbidden.

IV. Thou shalt keep thy profile clean — do not use offensive usernames or profile pictures.

V. Thou shalt protect the community — if you witness any wrongdoing, you should report it privately to the admins.

VI. Thou shalt keep discussions focused — stay on topic within the right channels; when in doubt, ask the admins for guidance.

VII. Thou shalt respect differing opinions — disagree and converse objectively and don’t be condescending when someone has a different opinion.

VIII. Thou shalt participate and engage — bring your ideas, questions, and energy to build the community strong.

IX. Thou shalt guard the privacy of others — personal information and private conversations should not be shared without consent.

X. Thou shalt collaborate joyfully and learn with passion — rejoice in learning, teamwork, and the building of great things together.
