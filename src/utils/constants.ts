Here’s how we keep things fun, safe, and awesome for everyone:

1. **Be Kind to Everyone**\n
   Treat all members with respect. Harassment, discrimination, or any form of hate speech isn’t welcome here. Let’s make this a place where everyone feels valued!

2. **Promote with Permission**\n
   Got a cool project or business to share? Awesome! Just check with the admins first to make sure it fits the vibe. No spamming, please!

3. **Keep It Safe**\n
   Don’t share harmful or shady stuff like malicious links, pirated content, or anything that could hurt the community. Safety first!

4. **Choose a Friendly Profile**\n  
   Pick a username and profile picture that keep things positive. Offensive or inappropriate profiles aren’t the way to go.

5. **Look Out for Each Other**\n 
   See something off? Let the admins know privately. Reporting helps keep our community strong and safe.

6. **Stay on Topic**\n
   Keep chats focused in the right channels. Not sure where to post? Ask an admin—they’re here to help!

7. **Embrace Different Views**\n 
   It’s okay to disagree, but keep it respectful and open-minded. Let’s learn from each other without being dismissive.

8. **Jump In and Engage**\n
   Share your ideas, ask questions, and bring your energy! The more you participate, the stronger our community becomes.

9. **Respect Privacy**\n
   Don’t share anyone’s personal info or private chats without their permission. Trust is key!

10. **Have Fun and Learn Together**\n
   Dive into collaboration, spark new ideas, and enjoy building something amazing with the team. Let’s make great things happen!

Thanks for being part of The Geek Trybe, let’s make it an awesome place together!
